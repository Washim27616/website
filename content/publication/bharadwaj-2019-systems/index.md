abstract: "Systems and methods for performing focused blind deconvolution of signals received by a plurality of sensors are disclosed. In some embodiments, this may include determining a cross-correlation of first and second signals, obtaining a cross-correlation of a first response function and a second response function based on the cross-correlation of the first and second signals and subject to a first constraint that the first and second response functions are maximally white, and obtaining the first and second response functions based on the cross-correlation of the first and second response functions and subject to a second constraint that the first and second response functions are maximally front-loaded."
