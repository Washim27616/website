### Geophysics is largely an observational science, and the ability to interpret measured data is fundamental to progress.

{{< figure src="fig_models.png" title="Three virtues of models used in geophysical signal processing. Blue arrow indicate my previous research directions, where the signal models were developed towards their better versions. Ongoing and potential future projects are marked in red. Note: these virtues are subjective and are assigned in regards to a specific application and experimental setup." numbered="true" lightbox="true" >}}




<div style="text-align: justify">
For given measurements of an experiment,  
our first task as geophysicists is to
build a model, in other words, identify the structure of the measurements. 
Then, we interpret the data  
with an _implicit belief_ that our model explains them.
If the model is too simple, 
the inversion might result in a significant bias in our interpretation, e.g.,
we can assume a linear stress-strain relationship during the analysis of seismic waves due to an 
earthquake,
however this model is questionable when analyzing seismograms close to large magnitude earthquakes.
On the other hand, when the models are too complicated, the 
subsequent optimization algorithms may not be easy to formulate.
For example, full waveform inversion of seismograms is based on models that encode the complex 
physical laws concerning seismic wave 
propagation. As a consequence   
the recorded waves have a 
strong non-linear dependence on  
certain subsurface properties, and the gradient-based optimizer
often 
converges to an inaccurate Earth model i.e., a local minima, where the simulated waves only
partially explain the records.

### My research seeks simple, reliable, and flexible signal models for seismic inversion that improve over their predecessors.

It allows for an accurate characterization
of the subsurface structures, at both global and exploration scales, 
and also of natural and induced seismicity. 
Our current models are established 
on well-understood physical principles. 
However,
they have to be
allowed to evolve 
with the developments in instrumentation and data availability.
For example, conventional signal models might not be optimal for 
processing waves that are recorded using fiber optic cables. 
More importantly,  my research will leverage vast 
amounts of data that are being generated by our seismometers to show that 
__improved models can also be learned directly from the data__.
Researchers in disciplines such as computer science and engineering are being constantly 
challenged to develop methods that learn models given big data.
However, those methods don't constitute a skeleton that can build 
on the top of the existing physical principles. Internalizing their methods into seismic imaging 
has to be done in a way that we don't ignore the physics that is at the core of our systems. 
My role in the geophysics department is to internalize advances in disciplines like 
electrical engineering, applied mathematics and computer science. 


For a model to succeed in its mission of
treating the data, it must be a good compromise
between three qualities: simplicity, reliability, and flexibility.
There virtues
in the view of the experimental goal and setup.
Inverse problems based on simple models are stable and easy to solve; although, 
it is questionable if these models are appropriate 
for complex measurements.
Reliable models capture the true essence of the data; however, they 
may not necessarily explain all the details in the data.
Flexible models have the capacity to explain the data to the fullest, however, given
insufficient data, they fail to provide reliable estimates;  they  should often be modified with additional constraints to have a reliable inversion. I have depicted the seismic inversion models that I developed in the past in the Figure. In this figure, the models are torn between the three qualities, where my contribution allowed development of ideal models.
