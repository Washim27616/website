  * Furthered field knowledge in machine learning by developing data processing methods such as blind deconvolution and source separation.

  * These methods are designed to automatically i.e., without human intervention, factorize seismic waveforms and thereby output key features pertaining 
to either sources or subsurface characteristics. 

  * Developed HPC-optimized Julia open-source software libraries to perform regression during the above-mentioned factorization.

  * Presented research results at applied mathematics, seismology and applied geophysics conferences to audience of 100+; published the results in major IEEE and seismology journals.

  * Gathered and analyzed data on research interests of colleagues in order to successfully organize departmental seminars for two semesters.

  * Developed computational imaging algorithms for a seismic system that performs real-time (within ~5-7 minutes) mapping of the Earth's structure ahead of a tunnel boring machine. 

  * Successfully coordinated with a group of civil and mechanical engineers to test the above-mentioned system for hazard assessment during excavation.

  * Presented at industry conferences to audiences of up to 50-100 professionals.

  * Engaged ~70-80 students in several workshops on inverse problems/ seismic data analysis that focus on teaching via interactive computing with MATLAB.

  * Effectively maintained and tested departmental software library packages.
