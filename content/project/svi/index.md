* My research in this direction 
introduces super-virtual interferometry, a method to enhance  
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of certain seismic phases (for example: head-wave refractions and diffractions),
which follow a common subsurface ray path before being 
recorded at receivers.
[\[paper\]](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/188/1/263/633573)

* This method can not only enhance the SNR of the far-offset refracted seismic energy but also can detect the presence of diving waves in the first arrivals.

* This research also demonstrates the application of this methodology to enhance the core-diffracted arrivals in the earthquake records.
