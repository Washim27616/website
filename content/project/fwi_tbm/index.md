The Earth’s properties, composition and structure ahead of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) should be mapped for hazard assessment during excavation. For mapping, a seismic system is deployed on the machine’s cutter head, with a few sources and sufficiently many sensors.

* This project studies the feasibility of using 2-D SH full waveform inversion to this near-surface imaging problem, where the 
images need to be available in near real time and without human interaction.
* The focus was on a system for soft soils, where shear waves are better and easier 
to interpret than compressional waves.
* This study uses data acquired in a 
number of field settings by a shear-wave vibrator source that mimic realistic TBM configurations.
