### Cycle Skipping in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)
"When the seismic waveforms are too complicated to be analyzed during inversion, a simplification of them into envelope-like bumpy waveforms can be useful."

* This research formulates a bump functional that computes the data misfit in seismic inversion
after a simplification. 
* A multi-objective FWI strategy, where the bump functional is 
used as an auxiliary functional to overcome the well-known cycle-skipping problem, is proposed.
* Advantages of seismic inversion that maximizes the correlation between the observed and modelled seismic data.
